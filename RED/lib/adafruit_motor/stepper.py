====================================================

Stepper motors feature multiple wire coils that are used to rotate the magnets connected to the
motor shaft in a precise way. Each increment of the motor is called a step. Stepper motors have a
varying number of steps per rotation so check the motor's documentation to determine exactly how
precise each step is.
