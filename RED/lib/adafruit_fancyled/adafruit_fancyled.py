FancyLED is a CircuitPython library to assist in creating buttery smooth LED animation.
It's loosely inspired by the FastLED library for Arduino, and in fact we have a "helper"
library using similar function names to assist with porting of existing Arduino FastLED
projects to CircuitPython.

# FancyLED provides color- and palette-related utilities for LED projects,
# offering a buttery smooth look instead of the usual 8-bit-like "blip blip"
# effects often seen with LEDs.  It's loosely inspired by, but NOT a drop-in
